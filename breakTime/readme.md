# BreakTime

## Description

## Notes for me.
background script works in the background and listens for any kind of triggers
content scripts are the scripts that actually interact wih the web page
so basically if I want to write the alarm logic it should be in content script
? don't know if the alarm timer should be in the background script
!! sommething like this can be the design, background script can listen for timer and trigger content script
!! the switch can also be triggered by background script
